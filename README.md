# rustyHIDScripts Repository

Welcome to the HIDScripts repository!

This repository is a personal collection of scripts written for the P4wnP1 a.l.o.a platform. It contains a set of custom scripts designed to interact with Human Interface Devices (HID) and can be used for various ethical hacking and security testing purposes. Please ensure that you have explicit permission from the target system owner before using these scripts.

## Make chatGPT do it for you *EXPERIMENTAL*
Just copy and paste the text in [chatGPTHelper](/chatGPTHelper.txt) into a new chatGPT prompt. This allows you to generate scripts, and convert some ducky scripts into HIDscripts. Remember this is experimental and I am trying to get even better prompts to make it easier.

# About P4wnP1 a.l.o.a
[P4wnP1 a.l.o.a](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa) is an open-source penetration testing platform specifically designed to run on Raspberry Pi devices. It allows security researchers and penetration testers to emulate HID devices and perform USB-based attacks. P4wnP1 a.l.o.a is a powerful tool that can be utilized for various security testing scenarios when used responsibly and legally.

# Installation
To install P4wnP1 a.l.o.a, follow the instructions provided in the official GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/RoganDawes/P4wnP1_aloa). Make sure you have a compatible Raspberry Pi device and meet all the prerequisites before proceeding with the installation.

Once you have P4wnP1 a.l.o.a set up and running on your Raspberry Pi, you can add custom scripts to the USB tab on the website GUI to use the HIDScripts from this repository.
